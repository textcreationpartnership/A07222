            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9898:8"/>But God in his nature, place, and eſſence, is greater then man.

Now, if he had in him the nature of any of his creatures, that is, to be limited vnto one, contained in place, or conſiſting of any materiall ſubſtance, the ſame would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comber his diuine eſſence: for hee doth not come within the compaſſe of their limited nature, place, nor number: for by that meanes, wee ſhould derogate from his holy and diuine Deitie, and eſſence of a Creator. Seeing therefore, that God is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9898:9"/>not compounded of material ſubſtance, he can not be a bodie. And ſeeing hee is not a bodie, he can not bee contained in place, neither wholly, nor in part: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it may properly be ſaid, that hee is no where: namely, that no part of him is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited within any place to be pointed at, or deſcribed. For like as hee made all things by the power of his beeing; So doth the ſame power enter into al things: ſill all things: &amp; containe all things. And for ſo much as the ſame being &amp; power is indiuiſible, it is whole in all, and whole in euery part.

For how could the creatures be, if they wanted place? Or, to what purpoſe ſerued place, if there were not creature, to ſupply them?

               <p>Theſe opinions may be anſwered thus, That making, or creating, are referred to natures and ſubſtances: and that all ouginall nature; &amp; ſubſtances are good; And therefore that God, who is al good, is the Creator, and maker of them. Now euill, is neither a nature, nor a ſubſlance: but an income, which is fallen into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſubſlances: And therefore not in the time of creation, but is come in ſince, by a colaterall meanes.

               <p>By theſe concluſions, It is manifeſt, that the wiſdome and promdence of God for ſpeciall purpoſes and occaſions, hath made and ordained theſe three numbers, time, and place: not that they are any things, natures, nor ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, in reſpect of them ſelues; but in regard of the vſe and employment thereof: for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, placing, and conueying of things according to their qualities, natures, and effects. And for the beginning, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and furniſhing thereof.</p>
               <p>Time properly of it ſelfe, is neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue nor paſſiue: It is neither eſcence nor ſubſtance, and ſcarcely can be ſaid to haue exiſtence.

In this appeareth the reaſon wherefore the worthy vnd erſtanding of

Now, for that <hi>I</hi> ſo generally finde, that reaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall part, to bee ſo vniuerſally caried away, ſeduced, and ouer-ruled by the meere ſenſitiue powers, entertaining the euill and forbidden things, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the good, allowable and lawfull: I haue made thus bolde to diſtinguiſh betweene theſe two times, and to giue this camat to the poſſeſſers thereof, that they ſtriue not ouermuch, to poſſeſſe or entertaine the number, place, and time, of theſe tranſitorie and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bleſſings, as that thereby they looſe, and faile to bee of the number, place, and time, of the elect: and bee caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of the damned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of vtter perdition.

And ſo much the more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is the ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>To come neerer to this point. It is plaine by ſundry places of the holy Bible, that God alone, numbreth, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp; diuideth: he meaſureth times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeaſons: Therefore let him ſtand for the numberer, placer, diſpoſer, and appointer of all creatures, their places,

And let all his creatures be then numbered, placed, and limited, according to their creations, nature, qualities and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, not ſtriuing againſt the purpoſe of his diuine prouidence, or adding, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing, too, or from, what hee hath appoindted or created.</p>
               <p>To diſcouer this, <hi>I</hi> muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and the other creatures, and the cauſes and markes they tend too, and ayme at: together, with the admirable bleſſing of reaſon: and to what meaſure the capacity of man thereby extendeth, for the ſearching out the natures, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, times, ſeaſons places, and vſes of the other creatures, which could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It cannot be denied, but that God hath created all things, firſt for his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, wherein he appointeth ſeuerall vſes and ſeruices: And within the compaſſe of this dutie, are all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well men and Angels, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>This is the condition of the Sunne, the Moone, the Firmament, and all the whole gainiſhed and rich decked skies, with infinite numbers of Starres.

               <p>It is againſt nature, for Creatures of one kind, to deſtroy one an other: which is a great argument of prenatication of the nature and reaſon of man: in that they ceaſe not continually and againſt nature, to worke one an others confuſion. Let vs proceed a little further: &amp; ſet theſe three, number, place, and time, to work ſimply of themſelues: they neither ingender, nor
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9898:42"/>bring forth any things: albeit, in them, and by them, that is, in their moulds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit numbers are generated and brought forth. Let vs ſprinckle a fewe holy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in theſe cauſes, to make them the more ſaucey; leaſt ſtriuing to ſet our conupt reaſon ouer high, we caſt it to the duſt. As in the firſt Creation, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, that there ſhould be any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectio, or foule matter, or defect, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in mans nature: So now, nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted, &amp; altogether polluted by diſobedience, It is both againſt, &amp; aboue this corrupt nature, that any perfection ſhould remaine in man: Albeit, there are that maintaine a ſparke or remnant of perſection, of the firſt originall nature, to remaine: whereby it may againe worke his former perfectio. This is againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: as much as to ſunder &amp; take apart wines from water, after it is once mingled: for no polluted thing entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, can afterwards be clenſed from this polutio: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dye wil neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken cleane out of the white cloath. It is to be obſerued, that Chriſt in miniſtring
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9898:43"/>the Sacrament of his bleſſed bodie and blood; Firſt he brake the bread, and they cate it: and then hee gaue the cuppe, and all was done, whilſt he was really and perſonally amongſt them.</p>
               <p>It is vnnaturally holden, that they did really and naturally cate his very fleſh, and drink his very blood: This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is againſt the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be the thing which it repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: or for the thing ſignified, to be the ſignifier, or betokener of that which is ſignified. Then it is againſt nature, that Chriſt as he was very man, being preſent and perſonally among them, performing this office himſelfe, ſhould at one inſtant be, &amp; not be. For, as he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo was he local. Now to deliuer himſelf, &amp; to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and yet remaine in the ſame ſubſtace, of and by himſelfe, at the ſame inſtant, is againſt nature. Beſides, that he ſhould ſo exhauſt or drawe his moſt precious blood, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bread (which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be his real &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly body) was eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9898:43"/>there ſhould bee therein no parte of his bloud: and more, that himſelfe ſhould be at one inſtant abſolute man, &amp; at the ſame inſtant, ſee himſelfe viſibly caten with the teeth of men, in diſtinct and ſenerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This is againſt the nature of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and ſo againſt both. For Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not miracles, not natures to bee enanged. Beſides, in miracles, things did not at one, and the ſame inſtant, containe two ſeuerall natures: nor one nature in two ſeuerall places: as in the miracle at the mariage: as long as the water remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned water, it was not wine: and after it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wine, it was no longer water: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it wine and water, all at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, though turned in leſſe then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neither was it water in two ſeuerall places, nor wine in two places, otherwiſe then by diuiding it into ſeuerall cupps or veſſells. I make bolde to giue a touch of this miſterie, which I holde to be of deeper conſideration then mans reaſon can reach into: which being a matter of ſpirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apprehended but by the eye of the ſame ſpirit, hauing regard to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d life before ſpoken of. Herein <hi>I</hi> obſerue, if men
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9898:44"/>be ſo bold to rack and ſtraine theſe great matters, what is it that they will leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the leſſe &amp; meaner cauſe?

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9898:45"/>and by meanes, which in the enſuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is not allowed.

By theſe it appeareth, that God hath prouided ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial matters to paſſe from man to man, or to be vſed by man.

The law being to take conſtruction moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtraightly for repreſſing of Vſury.</p>
               <p>The law it ſelfe is a prohibiting law, in no iote giuing libertie, but repreſſing. So are the wordes <hi>Negatiue,</hi> and forbidding. And vpon that reaſon, none of theſe words can be ſhained to make any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Theſe wordes in the cloſe of the ſentence: <hi>And no more greater game, or ſumme thereupon to be had;</hi> Do ſufficiently explaine, that by no meanes 100. li. by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ceurſe to be put out, may yeeld aboue the gaine of 10. li. for a whole yeare: But 100. li. put out for 3.6.9. months, and the money and vſe taken at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the yeare, may and doth yeeld a greater gaine then the rate of 10. li. for a whole yeare.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, the Lender may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9898:49"/>again diſpoſe the ſame principal and vſe' for more gaine within the ſame yeare: and ſo not ſaued by the words nor mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſee how Reaſon can bring the former words to this concluſion. <hi>And ſo after that rate and not aboue: of, or for a more or leſſe ſumme: or for ſhorter or longer time.</hi> Theſe words being in body of the clauſe, haue refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to a rate: which rate is before expreſſed; that the forbearing of 100. ſhall not raiſe aboue 10. pounds, for one whole yeare.</p>
               <p>In this behalfe, the borrower is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, but the Lender: for the words are; <hi>No man ſhall take about</hi> 10 <hi>pounds, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that as the Lawe is made onely againſt the taker, ſo is there no libertie for him to take any thing, that may exceed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rate of 10 for a whole year. Otherwiſe, this miſchiefe would enſue: the <hi>Lender</hi> would depart with his monie, for one, two, or three moneths, to one man, and then rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9898:49"/>his vſe mony within the yeare, contrary to the meaning of the Lawe: by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing &amp; placing it within one yeare: which vnder correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can by no means be conſtrued to bee ſaued by the wordes of the Lawe.</p>
               <p>A word or two, concerning the rate which <hi>I</hi> take to be double. A rate of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and a rate of time. Theſe two, are ſpecially to be conſidered: for ſeeing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot worke this matter, you muſt permit Time to doe what office it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to performe. To this purpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether there be one, or more takers, at one or more times, within the yeare, is not material: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſpect is ſeeing they haue nothing to raiſe this rate of money, but their induſtry, imployment, and labour, with a limitation of a rated time for the vſe thereof: that they may haue the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all theſe without abatements. For the eye of Reaſon in this behalf, doth not regard how often the mony be letten within the yeare, nor to how many or fewe perſons: but that the forbearing of 100. li. for a whole yeare, ſhall yeeld the Lender no more or greater gaine 10. li.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9898:50"/>And in this behalfe, is ſpecially to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, the ſeuerall offices of the Lender and Borrower. The Lender departeth with his money vpon time, to raiſe his benefite: the Borrower, beſtoweth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by merchandiſing the money, with diligence, in time to raiſe the increaſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vſe of the money: If the Lender will take away any part of the time, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtatute, be doth not then allow the Borrower his full rate of time: and therefore of a conſequent, hee ought to abate it out of the rate of his vſe mony: for in this cauſe, thoſe two, that is, the rate of time, for which the vſe of time is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and the rate of money taken for vſe, muſt euer iumpe, to make the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning even. And common and ordinary reaſon yeeldeth, that no man will giue ſo much for any thing to bee payed at the end of one moneth, as hee would, if his payment were forborne a whole yeare. Such is the plaine caſe, as it is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vnderſtood: that the Lender, for one Moneth will take as much at the Moneths ende, as if he had forborne his vſe a whole yeare. But <hi>I</hi> take it, this error
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9898:50"/>hath grown out of a fallaſie or miſtaking in Art, by ſome Arithmatitian,
<note place="margin">Art abuſed.</note> that hath calculated this proportion by a wrong rule: not fully fitting this purpoſe. for <hi>I</hi> conceiue, it hath proceeded onely by the rule of diuiſion: when it ſhould haue beene wrought, partly by diuiſion, and partly by addition: as the true conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Tables will maniſeſtly expreſſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in a word or two, let me remember againe the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene contemplation and action. Any that worketh barely by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by conceite: but hee that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any act indeed, muſt haue matter and ſtuſte: ſigures and cyphers, make no ſummes of money. Therefore if the Lender will haue conſideration, he muſt diſpoſe of his money and time: that hee, who will haue mony &amp; time, may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giue conſideration. In this cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the matter of Art, &amp; the point from whence <hi>I</hi> conceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error to ariſe, is to be looked into. It ſeemeth the Arithmatitias hath wrought only by diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the firſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9898:51"/>part of diuiſion, there are two requiſite things, a <hi>Diuidende, &amp; Deuiſer,</hi> which in this caſe muſt be eſſenciall &amp; ſubſtatiall, and not by conceſt and imagination. Let vs ſee, mony muſt needs be the <hi>Diuidend,</hi> and time the <hi>Deuiſor.</hi> Put the caſe a man le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a 100. li. for one month, what may the Lender take? The Arithmatition ſaith, I whole yeere will yeeld 10. li. then he diuideth time, by time: One yeere into 12. parts: ſo that here time is both the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidend</hi> and <hi>Deniſor:</hi> then he diuideth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by time: that is 10. li. by 12 months, &amp; he findeth the 12. part of 10. li. to be 16. s. 8. d. which he allotteth to one moneth. The rule is true, but not to be vſed in this caſe: for Reaſon the founder of Art, will ſhew, that he hath no warrant to meaſure by this rule: in that he hath no eſſentiall Deuiſor:
<note place="margin">Reaſon and Art. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with truth.</note> for if you marke it, hee wanteth 11. months of his yeare, at the time of his diuiſion. And ſo he worketh a ſubſtantial <hi>Diuidend,</hi> of 10. li. by an imagined <hi>Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> of 12. moneths, when there is but one occurred: but his courſe ſhould be, as in the caſe of contribution: the ſhorter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9898:51"/>time of forbearance of the vſe, ſhould not haue ſo large allowance as the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>And on this point, doth Reaſon and Art conclude, which are more plainly expreſſed in theſe enſuing Tables: the falſe being reproued by the exceſſe, and the true, raiſed from leſſe to more, as the rate of time, and vſe of the mony giueth occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:9898:52"/>
               <p>I haue drawn theſe Tables, as patterns or Modells to ſhewe and diſcouer, the truth from the falſe, and to manifeſt how truth and Art ſtill drawe to one Period. I the more inſiſt vppon this for my ſole example, becauſe it is a matter ſo directly againſt nature: and ſophiſtically brought into the danger and ouerthrowe of mens eſtate: for all the world muſt confeſſe, that in this caſe, as hauing regard to matter of ſubſtance, nothing is enforced to produce ſomething. And though I meant not to fill this place with law arguments, yet let me borrow a word for further explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my meaning. Let vs ſee what the lender muſt doe, to rayſe ten of his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, hee muſt contribute towards the rayſing thereof, a proportion of money, and a proportion of time.
<note place="margin">Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Of mony a hundreth to rayſe ten: of time, one whole yeare. In this caſe as <hi>I</hi> ſaid before, there is no reſpect of the borrower: well, then the lender is tied to both theſe contributions: ſo ſtill the rate of his gaine muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ten for the rate of a whole yeare of time. In this caſe the lender is tyed to his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9898:52"/>certainty. Then it followeth,
<note place="margin">Election.</note> hee can haue no election, differing from that rate of time which is the maine point. Let vs ſee what the borrower is to receiue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. In which is to be obſerued, ſuch a proportion of mony and time as may performe a ratable allowance: that the vſe mony may not exceed tenne for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth for a whole yeare: which perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he is to render backe the mony bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed: &amp; as for vſe, the law alloweth non. Let vs examine this by the rule of reaſon: In all natural cauſes, time muſt be abidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> working &amp; perfecting of al increaſe &amp; growing: the beaſts bynature knoweth the time of bringing forth their yong: the birds keepe their egs vnder their feathers, til an appointed time to produce chicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; the trees &amp; herbs, according to their ſorts, require time for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ripening of their fruits. The Sun in the ſpheare of heauen, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a whole yeare to bring himſelf to his reuolution. If all theſe, with many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of other things, ſtay their time by their naturall courſe, why ſhould not the lender premit the full occurrency of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9898:53"/>time, for the raiſing of his benefit vpon a barren, fruitleſſe, and vnnaturall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
<note place="margin">Things ſold in tender age for want of allowance of time, are of leſſe value then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would be.</note> Though many things offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet <hi>I</hi> ſtriue to be brieſe. Obſerue therefore theſe reſemblances. In all manner of eateable fleſhe, The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lambe will not yeelde ſo much as the well growne ſheepe: the yong veale, not ſo much as the full growne oxe. The young chick, late out of the ſhel, not ſo much as the henne or capon: and ſo of many other things that time cauſeth to increaſe, both in growth and price. Now if the owner will ſell any of theſe in their tenderneſſe, hee muſt bee contented to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of that he would require, if the ſame things were growne to more greatneſſe. If this be ſo, then in reaſon there is more cauſe the lender ſhuld for beare his whole time before hee receiue his conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, howſoeuer hee doth his principall.</p>
               <p>Let vs touch a little the exceeding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and vſe the Lawe hath, in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes of time. Eſtates for yeares, muſt haue a certaine beginning and ending. Inheritances haue commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

But among the reſt, let mee conclude with one or two, to diſcouer what time, ioyned with ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth both enable &amp; diſable: <hi>I</hi> meane not to vouch any caſe. It is not vnknown that one attainted by act of Parliament, part of his lands ſold: time and the act of Parliament made the ſale good. But this attainder being taken off by another acte of Parliament, and the former act made voide; Time and the act of Parliament, did reſtore both the blood and lands of the attainted: &amp; made their eſtates voide,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9898:54"/>which formerly were not.

The Kings te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant acknowledgeth a bargaine and ſale of land, held in capite to an other and his heires: before the deede be enrolled, the bargainer dieth, his ſon within age. In this caſe, the ſonne of this bargainor is ward. But the barganie alſo dieth within the ſix moneths, &amp;c. his ſon within age, &amp; within the 6. meneths the bargaine &amp; ſale is inrolled. In this caſe, the ſon of the bargainer ſhall be out of ward, &amp; the ſon of the barganie ſhall be in ward, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9898:54"/>to time. I put theſe caſes, onely to make knowne how flexible time doth turne and wind according to the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſerueth, and how ſtoute and ſliffe it is in ſome other caſes, as the rules of law doth gouerne and direct it: and though this reſemble not the caſe in all points, yet it ſheweth, that in this behalfe, time is not to be diſpoſed at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> election or choyce of any, but according to the true conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcope &amp; meaning of the law: which in this caſe is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the lender.</p>
               <p>A word or two concerning this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mony &amp; time.

There is a neceſſitie, both theſe ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though <hi>I</hi> know there be other <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> in theſe caſes: yet I make theſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, to make plaine my demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the neceſſitie of an eſſenciall <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend</hi> and <hi>Diuiſor,</hi> at the time of the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
